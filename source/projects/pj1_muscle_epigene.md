# Epigenomic changes of sheep muscle along postnatal development 
Dec 2020 â€“ present, with Associate ProfHongbing Han

1. display growth tendency of muscle(cross-sectional area, CSA)
2. visualize **interplay** among DNA methylation, accessible chromotin region and trancriptome 
3. **highlighten** 3 main physiologic activities with 6 clusters DEGs involving - **SOM** and Mfuzz
4. show methylation variation behind different clusters by controling genome features, methylation types
5. **model** the relationship between methylation and gene expression - Rstan, **modified Bayesian hierachical model**
6. **contribute**:conception,analysis and write; **under writen**
