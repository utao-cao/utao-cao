I am a research assistant at the Zhejiang University School of Medicine. My major research work focus on landscape of somatic mutation in autoimmune disease, as well as establishing a database to further prioritize regulation elements in liver disease.

My main research interest focus on **interdisciplinary research** of genetics and statistics with help of computational tools. I wish to combined **Genetics** with **statistics** and **machine learning** in the biology area to untangle complexity of genetic landscape and infer potential gene regulation and, possibly, validate it.

My postgraduate work includes analysis of epigenomics, interplay between DNA methylation and transcriptome in muscle.
