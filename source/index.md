I am a research assistant at the Zhejiang University School of Medicine. My major research work focus on landscape of somatic mutation in autoimmune disease, as well as establishing a database to further prioritize regulation elements in liver disease. My postgraduate work includes analysis of epigenomics, interplay between DNA methylation and transcriptome in muscle.

My research interest mainly focus on **interdisciplinary research** of genetics and statistics with help of computational tools. I wish to combined **Genetics** with **statistics** and **machine learning/deep learning** in the biology area to untangle complexity of genetic landscape and infer potential gene regulation and, possibly, validate it.

I enjoy myself to gain new knowledge, expand skill set and try to exert it on my projects.
