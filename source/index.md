I am a third-year postgraduate student majoring in Animal Genetics and Breeding at the China Agricultral University. 

My main research interest focus on **interdisciplinary research**, **statistics**, **machine learning** with application in the biology area. My recent work includes analysis of time series epigenomics, interplay between DNA methylation and transcriptome in muscle.

## Skills
1. Languages: Python, R, Bash(grep/awk/sed)
2. packages: Rstan, data.table, RShiny [one-day Demo](https://derekterry.shinyapps.io/dataPresentation/), Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Pytorch
3. Human Languages: fluent Chinese, good English, basic French
4. experience of omics: DNA methylation(WGBS), ATAC, WGS(SNP calling),ChIP-seq
5. Developer Tools: HPC platform, Jupyter Notebooks, Git, VS Code
6. knownledge Repository: [yuque](https://www.yuque.com/qinlaodehashiqi/dzpluz)
